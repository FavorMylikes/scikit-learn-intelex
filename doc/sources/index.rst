Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn*
#####################################################

Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn is a seamless way to speed up your Scikit-learn application. 
The acceleration is achieved through the use of the Intel(R) oneAPI Data Analytics Library
(`oneDAL <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDAL>`_). Patching scikit-learn makes it a
well-suited machine learning framework for dealing with real-life problems.

Designed for Data Scientists and Framework Designers
----------------------------------------------------
Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn* was created to give data scientists the easiest way to get a better performance
while using the familiar scikit-learn package.

Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn* depends on Intel(R) daal4py. You can learn more in `daal4py documentation <https://intelpython.github.io/daal4py>`_.
